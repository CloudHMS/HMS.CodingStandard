# LOGGING CONVENTIONS

1. Logging always provides 3 types
- Error.
- Warning.
- Verbose.

2. Logging should contain the **class name** and **method name**.

3. Logging should always contain the **request id** (generated by the entry point).

4. Logging should collect input data as much as possible.

5. Logging framework should have the ability to assign tags as many as possible. E.g.: `proxy name`, `service name`, `device type`,...
> Not to confuse with text content. The `tag` itself makes other systems to customize the display and filtering as their favor.
